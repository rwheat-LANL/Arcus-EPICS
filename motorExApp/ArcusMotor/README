motorExApp/arcusMotorDriver

This directory contains the example application, a simple 'c' program that calls
an IOC shell and then sleeps. When this compiled program is called with a
command line argument of a script file, the IOC is executed using the
appropriate database file, libraries, etc. Compiling the code in this directory
creates the executable and build the appropriate database file for the Arcus
motors. The executable is placed in the bin/linux-x86_64 directory and the dbd
file in the dbd directory.
